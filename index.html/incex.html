    <ol>
        <li>First, for the cream, put the liquid cream into a saucepan and when it reaches the boiling point, add the chocolates and stir over low heat until it melts.</li>
        <li>The cream, which is liquid at first, will reach the consistency of chocolate cream in the refrigerator until you make your macarons.</li>
        <li>For the macarons, start beating the egg whites with a pinch of salt in a glass bowl at low speed.</li>
        <li>When foaming occurs, granulated sugar is added 5 times.</li>
        <li>Continue whisking at high speed until it reaches the consistency of shaving foam. (you can color this part with food coloring)</li>
        <li>Half of the almonds, cocoa and powdered sugar, passed through the robot and sieve, are added to the meringue and the whites are mixed from bottom to top with gentle movements without crushing.</li>
        <li>Then the other half is added and mixed in the same way.</li>
        <li>The macaron mixture filled into a piping bag is squeezed into a 1 TL size amount at 3 cm intervals on a tray lined with baking paper and dried for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated oven at 160 degrees for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>When it cools down, it is removed and matched.</li>
        <li>Spread ganache cream in between and serve 1 day later.</li>
        <li>These measurements yield 35 single and 12 -13 double macarons.</li>
        <p>For 8-10 people: 1 hour Preparation, 15 minutes Cooking</p>
